Young Singles & Couples in the mainstream segment continue to be the main buyers of chips.
Potential growth opportunities have been identified among both Young Families and Older Families.
The trial store has shown improved performance due to the new store layout adjustments.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss specific sections in more detail, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm happy to arrange a meeting at your convenience to review the findings together.
